Hello! My name is Judy. ðŸ‘‹ 

I am an interdisciplinary researcher working on a just transition towards a climate neutrality through technology and policy. I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Ziegler Research Group](https://ziegler.chbe.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech's [School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering](https://www.chbe.gatech.edu/). My research focuses on Direct Air Capture (DAC), a technology that captures carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. I am working on accelerating DAC deployment by understanding technology change, its integration with renewable energy, and the relevant equity impacts on communities and stakeholders. I also work with Georgia Tech's Center for Sustainable Communities Research and Education ([SCoRE](https://scre.research.gatech.edu/)), a project partner with the US Department of Energy funded Southeast Direct Air Capture Hub ([SEDAC](https://www.sseb.org/programs/sedac_hub/)), on engaging with community members to understand concerns and help inform engineering decisions.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
