Hello! My name is Judy. ðŸ‘‹ I am an interdisciplinary researcher working on a just transition towards climate neutrality through technology and policy. 

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Ziegler Research Group](https://ziegler.chbe.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech's [School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering](https://www.chbe.gatech.edu/). My research focuses on Direct Air Capture (DAC), a technology that captures carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. I am working on accelerating DAC deployment through understanding technology change, its integration with renewable energy, and the relevant equity impacts on communities and stakeholders. Through Georgia Tech's Center for Sustainable Communities Research and Education ([SCoRE](https://scre.research.gatech.edu/)), a project partner with the US Department of Energy funded [Southeast Direct Air Capture Hub](https://www.sseb.org/programs/sedac_hub/), I also engage with community members to understand their concerns and help inform engineering decisions. 

I received a Ph.D. in Climate and Energy Policy from Imperial College London in the UK under the supervision of [Prof. Joeri Rogelj](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/j.rogelj) and [Dr. Iain Staffell](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/i.staffell), funded by the [Imperial College President's PhD Scholarship](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/fees-and-funding/postgraduate-doctoral/grants-scholarships/presidents-phd/). Through my doctoral work, I interned at the [International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis](https://iiasa.ac.at/) in Austria researching the socio-political feasibility of net zero transitions under the mentorship of [Dr. Elina Brutschin](https://iiasa.ac.at/staff/elina-brutschin) in the Energy, Climate, and Environment Program. 

Before that, I received a B.S. (highest honors) in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology. There, I first began research on heterogenous catalysis under the mentorship of [Dr. Nathan Ellebracht](https://people.llnl.gov/ellebracht1) and [Prof. Chris Jones](https://jones.chbe.gatech.edu/). I then worked on DAC adsorbent degredation as a Research Chemist at Global Thermostat, a DAC spin-off company, and biomass conversion at the [Paul Scherrer Institute](https://www.psi.ch/en) in Switzerland.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
